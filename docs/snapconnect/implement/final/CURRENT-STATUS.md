## **üîß Technical Debt/Bugs to Fix**

1. **Event Context**
   - Currently hardcoded in `lib/types.ts`
   - Needs dynamic switching

2. **AI Assistant**
   - Only in Activity tab
   - Needs integration elsewhere

3. **Quest Verification**
   - Only GPS verification works
   - Photo verification is placeholder

4. **Mock Data**
   - All data is mocked
   - But sufficient for demo
