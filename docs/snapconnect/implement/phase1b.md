### 2. Test the Features
```bash
npm start
```

### Key User Flows to Test:
1. **Home Feed**: Like posts, tap comments, view user profiles
2. **Profile Tab**: View your profile, check post grid
3. **Search Tab**: Search for users, navigate to profiles
4. **Activity Tab**: View notifications (will be empty initially)
5. **User Profiles**: Follow/unfollow other users

### 3. Create Test Data
For best testing experience, create some test users and posts through the app or database directly.
