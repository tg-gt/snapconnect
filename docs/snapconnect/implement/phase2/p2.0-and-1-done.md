Excellent! I've successfully completed Week 1: Dual Feed System implementation according to the Phase 2 plan. Here's what I've accomplished:
âœ… Week 1 Implementation Complete - Dual Feed System
ðŸ”§ Core Infrastructure Added:
Hardcoded Event Context (lib/types.ts)
Added DEMO_EVENT_CONTEXT constant for PoC development
Includes event ID, name, participant ID, and dates
Feed Type System (lib/types.ts)
Added FeedType union type for 'following' | 'discovery'
Created FeedToggleProps interface
Enhanced API (lib/api.ts)
Updated getFeed() function to support FeedType parameter
Following Feed: Posts from users you follow + your own posts (reverse chronological)
Discovery Feed: Simple engagement-based ranking (likes + comments + recency)
FeedToggle Component (components/feed/FeedToggle.tsx)
Clean toggle UI for switching between Following/Discovery
Styled with active/inactive states using existing design tokens
Enhanced Home Tab (app/(protected)/(tabs)/index.tsx)
Added feed type state management
Integrated FeedToggle component
Updated header to show demo event name
Modified feed loading to support different feed types
ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria Met:
âœ… Following Feed: Reverse chronological posts from connections + own posts
âœ… Discovery Feed: Engagement-based algorithmic ranking
âœ… Feed Toggle: Smooth switching between feed types
âœ… Event Context: Header shows "SnapConnect Demo Event"
âœ… State Management: Proper feed state handling with refresh/pagination
ðŸ“± User Experience:
Users see the demo event name in the header (confirming event-scoped context)
Clean toggle between Following and Discovery feeds
Following feed shows newest posts first (reverse chronological)
Discovery feed shows most engaging content first
Smooth transitions when switching feed types
ðŸš€ Ready for Week 2:
The foundation is now set for Week 2: Quest System with:
Event context established and working
Enhanced feed system supporting event-scoped content
Clean component architecture for adding quest widgets
The dual feed system provides the core "Event OS" experience - users are now in a private Instagram clone scoped to the demo event, with intelligent content discovery alongside traditional chronological feeds.
Next up: Week 2 will add location-based quests, quest progress widgets, and GPS verification to transform this into a true gamified event experience!
