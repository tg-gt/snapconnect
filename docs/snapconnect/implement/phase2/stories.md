### **Project Feature Summary: Stories vs. Posts**

This project has a clear distinction between "stories" and "posts," similar to Instagram's model.

  * **Stories (Ephemeral Content)**:
      * Expire after 24 hours. The database schema includes an `expires_at` timestamp.
      * Displayed in a horizontal, scrollable bar at the top of the feed via `StoriesBar.tsx`.
      * View tracking is implemented with a separate `story_views` table.
      * Stored in a dedicated `stories` database table.
  * **Posts (Permanent Content)**:
      * Do not expire and are stored indefinitely.
      * Displayed in a vertical feed via `PostCard.tsx`.
      * Include full engagement features such as a like and comment system.
      * Stored in a dedicated `posts` database table with media support.

### **Issue & Resolution: Story Upload and Display**

**1. Initial Problem: Stories Not Appearing After Creation**

The initial issue was that newly created stories were not visible. Upon investigation, it was discovered that the app was saving local file URIs (e.g., `file:///private/var/...`) directly to the database. These local paths are not accessible to other users or the app for remote viewing.

**The Fix:**

A new `uploadMedia` function was implemented to upload media files to Supabase Storage first, and then store the public URL in the database. This ensures the media is accessible from anywhere.

**2. Second Problem: Failed Fetch During Upload on Web**

After the `uploadMedia` function was added, a `TypeError: Failed to fetch` error appeared in the console when trying to share a story from a web browser. This was because the `fetch(uri)` call was failing to process the URI from the local camera/image picker on the web.

**The Fix:**

The `uploadMedia` function was updated to handle different types of URIs (data URLs, blob URLs, and file paths) more robustly in various environments, including the web.

**3. Third Problem: Malformed Filename Causing Connection Reset**

The next issue was a `net::ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` error, caused by a malformed filename. The filename generation logic was incorrectly treating the entire data URL as a file extension, resulting in an extremely long filename (hundreds of thousands of characters).

**The Fix:**

The filename generation logic in the `uploadMedia` function was corrected to properly extract the file extension (e.g., `png`, `jpg`, `mp4`) from the MIME type of the data URL, creating a standard filename like `stories/{user_id}/{timestamp}_{random}.png`.

**4. Fourth Problem: Supabase Row-Level Security (RLS) Policy Violation**

After fixing the filename, a `403 (Bad Request)` error with the message `new row violates row-level security policy` appeared. This indicated that the Supabase Storage RLS policy was configured incorrectly. The policy was checking the wrong folder level for the user's ID. The file path is `stories/{user_id}/filename`, where the user ID is at index `[2]` in the folder structure, not `[1]`.

**The Fix:**

The SQL policy was corrected to check the second element of the folder path (`(storage.foldername(name))[2]`) to match the user's ID, thereby allowing authenticated users to upload files to their designated folders.

**5. Current Status: Story Successfully Posted but Not Visible**

The most recent update indicates that the story is now successfully posted to the Supabase Storage bucket, and a public URL is generated and stored in the database. However, the story still does not appear in the stories bar on the home page. The next step is to investigate why the stories are not being fetched or displayed correctly in the UI.

**Required Supabase Storage Setup (For Reference)**

To ensure media uploads function correctly, the following steps are required in the Supabase dashboard:

1.  **Create a Public Bucket**: Create a storage bucket named `media` and ensure it is enabled as a "Public bucket."
2.  **Set Up Storage Policies**: Run the following SQL policies in the Supabase SQL Editor to allow authenticated users to upload and delete their own media and to make all media publicly accessible for viewing.

<!-- end list -->

```sql
-- First, drop any existing policies to avoid conflicts
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can upload their own media" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Media is publicly accessible" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own media" ON storage.objects;

-- Allow authenticated users to upload their own media
-- File structure: posts/{user_id}/filename or stories/{user_id}/filename
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload their own media" ON storage.objects
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'media' AND
    auth.role() = 'authenticated' AND
    (storage.foldername(name))[2] = auth.uid()::text
  );

-- Allow public access to view media
CREATE POLICY "Media is publicly accessible" ON storage.objects
  FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'media');

-- Allow users to delete their own media
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own media" ON storage.objects
  FOR DELETE USING (
    bucket_id = 'media' AND
    auth.role() = 'authenticated' AND
    (storage.foldername(name))[2] = auth.uid()::text
  );
