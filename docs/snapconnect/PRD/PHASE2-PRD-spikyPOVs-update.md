**Perfect!** Those decisions give us a rock-solid foundation. You've essentially defined a **"Event Operating System"** that organizers can deploy for their events. This is genuinely compelling - let me create the Phase 2 PRD now.

## **ðŸ”„ UPDATED VERSION - Simplified Architecture**

**Key Changes Made:**
- âœ… **Removed confusing "dual-mode navigation"** - Keep existing 5-tab Instagram layout
- âœ… **Integrated event features within existing tabs** - No separate navigation system
- âœ… **Specified AI stack** - Pinecone/Supabase pgvector + OpenAI CLIP + GPT-4V
- âœ… **Simplified privacy approach** - Removed screenshot detection, moderate geofencing accuracy
- âœ… **Enhanced profile editing** - Pseudonymous handles, about me, location info
- âœ… **Modal-based detail screens** - Quest details, maps, leaderboards accessed from existing tabs

# Product Requirements Document: SnapConnect Phase 2
## Event Social Operating System with Privacy-First Gamification

### Executive Summary
Transform the existing SnapConnect Instagram MVP into a dedicated event social platform. Phase 2 creates a **temporary, private Instagram deployment per event** - users join a specific event and the entire app becomes that event's social network. This is NOT a dual-mode app - it's a single-purpose event operating system that organizers deploy as a privacy-first, gamified social layer for their specific event.

### Strategic Pivot & Market Opportunity
**Phase 1**: Instagram clone for college students (B2C social sharing)
**Phase 2**: Event social platform for event organizers (B2B engagement tools)

**Market Gap Identified**: No platform combines privacy-first design + social features + gamification specifically for events. Competitors like ConfyChat (messaging only), Mozi (friend tracking), and GooseChase (generic scavenger hunts) each solve pieces but miss the complete experience.

**Core Thesis - "Temporary, High-Trust Social Networks":**
- General public proximity-based social features are scary (safety concerns)
- Event environments create natural high-trust boundaries with barrier to entry
- Attendees can broadcast location, activities, beliefs more freely within event context
- "Level playing field" - everyone starts with 0 followers, encourages authentic, in-the-moment expression
- Ephemeral content removes "permanent consequences" anxiety

**Revenue Model**: B2B SaaS - Event organizers pay $500-5000 per event for white-label social experience included in ticket price.

### Extended Database Schema

#### Data Model Philosophy: Event-First Architecture
**Key Change**: All content is event-scoped from creation. No "general social" content exists.
- Every post, story, comment, like is created within an event context
- `event_id` is required (NOT NULL) for all content tables
- No backwards compatibility needed - this is a strategic pivot, not feature addition

### Navigation Architecture - Single-Purpose Event App

#### Core Architecture: Temporary Instagram Per Event
Users download the app â†’ Join specific event â†’ Experience a private Instagram clone scoped to that event only.

**Key Principle**: No general social features. All functionality is event-scoped from the moment users join.

```
Home Tab               Search Tab            Create Tab
â”œâ”€â”€ Event social feed  â”œâ”€â”€ Event participantsâ”œâ”€â”€ Post/Story creation
â”œâ”€â”€ Event stories bar  â”œâ”€â”€ Quest discovery   â”œâ”€â”€ Quest photo submission
â”œâ”€â”€ Active quests      â”œâ”€â”€ Join event w/code â”œâ”€â”€ Location quest completion
â”œâ”€â”€ Quest widgets      â””â”€â”€ [Event-only search] â””â”€â”€ Quest verification
â””â”€â”€ [Event-only content]

Activity Tab           Profile Tab
â”œâ”€â”€ Quest completions    â”œâ”€â”€ Event profile (pseudonymous)
â”œâ”€â”€ Event achievements   â”œâ”€â”€ Event handle editing
â”œâ”€â”€ Event notifications  â”œâ”€â”€ Event bio/info
â”œâ”€â”€ Leaderboard updates  â”œâ”€â”€ Quest history
â””â”€â”€ Social interactions  â””â”€â”€ Event achievements
```

#### MVP Scope: Single Event Per User
- Users join **one event at a time** (no event switching)
- All app state and content scoped to current event
- Multi-event "workspace" functionality deferred to Phase 3
- Simpler architecture and user experience

**Modal/Detail Screens** (accessed from tabs, not separate navigation):
- Event join modal (from Search)
- Quest detail screens (from Home)
- Event map (from Home quest widgets)
- Leaderboard (from Activity)
- Organizer dashboard (separate access)

### Enhanced Feed Architecture
**Dual-Feed System (X/Twitter style):**
- **Following Feed**: Reverse chronological (newest first), users you've connected with at event
- **Discovery Feed**: Algorithmic reranking by engagement + interest matching

**Key Principle**: Default to reverse chronological even if other content has more engagement
- Prevents "popularity spiral" where early posts dominate entire event
- Encourages fresh content creation throughout event duration
- Gives everyone equal opportunity for visibility regardless of early adoption

**Stories Display Logic:**
- Stories shown in reverse chronological order (most recent first)
- Complex state management for mid-sequence additions:
  - Display all stories in chronological order
  - Visual indicators: Unwatched (normal), Watched (grayed), New since last view (highlighted)
  - Database: `story_views` table with (user_id, story_id, viewed_at)
  - Continue from last unwatched + highlight new stories

### Granular Privacy Controls
**Contextual Broadcasting Philosophy:**
High-trust event environments allow more open sharing than general public social networks. Users can granularly control their broadcast settings:

**Geofenced Visibility:**
- Content only visible within event boundaries (moderate GPS accuracy Â±100m)
- Automatic content hiding when users leave event area
- **Implementation Strategy**: Simple distance calculation with generous radius (Â±500m)
- Prioritizes user experience over strict geo-enforcement
- Relies on event barrier-to-entry for primary security

**Audience Controls:**
- **All Participants**: Visible to everyone at the event
- **Connections Only**: Visible to people you've interacted with
- **Activity-Based**: Only visible to people doing similar quests/activities
- **Time-Bounded**: Expires at event end vs custom duration

**Situational Identity:**
- Anonymous event usernames (detached from real identity)
- Optional real name reveal for specific connections
- No imported follower counts or external social proof
- Fresh start encourages authentic, in-the-moment personality

#### Screen Hierarchy - Single Event Architecture
```

â”œâ”€â”€ (auth) [existing - but leads to event joining, not general social]
â””â”€â”€ (protected) [event-scoped from login]

## Summary: The Spiky POV Advantage

This Phase 2 PRD transforms SnapConnect from a generic social app into a specialized **"Temporary High-Trust Social Network Operating System"** that event organizers can deploy to create unforgettable, privacy-respecting experiences for their attendees.

### Unique Differentiators (Spiky POVs):

1. **High-Trust Environment Broadcasting**: Unlike general social platforms where proximity sharing is scary, event environments create natural safety boundaries that enable more open, authentic sharing.

2. **Level Playing Field Philosophy**: Everyone starts with 0 followers at each event, encouraging authentic self-expression detached from external social proof or past accomplishments.

3. **Reverse Chronological Default**: Fights the "popularity spiral" by showing newest content first, giving everyone equal visibility opportunity regardless of early adoption.

4. **Quality Over Quantity Incentives**: Flat daily content limits prevent spam while ensuring equal posting opportunities for all participants.

5. **AI-Verified Gamification**: Probabilistic quest verification with acceptable false positives adds game-like unpredictability while enabling sophisticated challenges.

6. **Contextual Privacy Controls**: Granular broadcasting settings (geofenced, activity-based, connection-level) that match the situational nature of event networking.

7. **Memory Preservation Before Deletion**: AI-curated highlight reels and connection export features preserve meaningful memories while maintaining ephemeral core experience.

### Business Model Advantages:
- **Transparent pricing** with cost caps builds organizer trust
- **B2B focus** avoids social media platform scaling challenges
- **Privacy-first positioning** differentiates from surveillance-based competitors
- **AI moat** through sophisticated quest verification and content discovery

**This is not just another social app - it's an ephemeral, privacy-first, gamified social operating system specifically designed for temporary communities in high-trust environments.**

**Ready for AI-driven development with specific, actionable tasks that build incrementally on the existing MVP foundation while implementing genuinely differentiated features that competitors can't easily replicate.**
