## Introduction

EventOS is a comprehensive event social platform that combines privacy-first design with gamification for event organizers. Built with React Native, Expo, and Supabase, it provides a temporary social network experience scoped to specific events, featuring location-based quests, AI-powered content recommendations, and ephemeral social interactions. This platform serves as an Event Operating System that organizers can deploy for their events to create engaging, gamified social experiences.
